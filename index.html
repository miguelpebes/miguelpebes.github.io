		   I am a Research Fellow in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at 
		   Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I received my PhD in Statistical Science from Indiana University 
		   Bloomington (2023), where I also Ph.D.-minored in Complex Networks and Systems, and served as a Visting Assistant 
		   Professor at the Department of Statistics (2022-2023). I received my M.S. in Statistics and B.S. in Computer Science from 
		   the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.<br>
		   <br>
		   My research integrates statistical modeling and computational inference methods for understanding and controllability of real-world systems. 
		   I have worked in various domains including telecommunications, fraud detection, pattern-change detection, mobility analysis,
		   risk management, hierarchy and network inference, and currently remote sensing and precision agriculture.<br>
		   <br>
		   My technical core includes Bayesian modeling, Bayesian Nonparametrics, Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, and 
		   diachronic applications of these methods or Bayesian Reinforcement Learning.
